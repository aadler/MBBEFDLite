## Description
**MBBEFDLite** is an `R` package which provides the probability mass,
distribution, quantile, random variate generation, and method of moments
parameter estimation functions for the MBBEFD distribution.

## Citation
If you use the package, please cite it as per
[CITATION](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MBBEFDLite/citation.html).

## Contributions
Please see
[CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/aadler/MBBEFDLite/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Security
Please see [SECURITY](https://github.com/aadler/MBBEFDLite/blob/master/SECURITY.md).

## Roadmap
### Major

 * Consider if there is a way to make the method-of-moments fitting more robust
 for cases where the initial `g` is too small---thus `p` is too large.
 
### Minor
 
 * There are no plans for minor changes at current.
